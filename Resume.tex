  Topic modelling (LDA) analysis of open source Java projects to characterize their software development processes. Using LDA we identified cohesive areas of functionalities such as logging or network I/O in the source code. We drew project-wide statistics such as cross-cutting of these functionalities to characterize the development of a project.\\

  & The focus was on improving relevance of algorithmic search overall as well as in specific segments by employing statistical methods to mine information from user click patterns from Internet Explorer and Microsoft Toolbar user click logs. My work on relevance of local search queries (containing locations) and offline computation of geo-specific popularity of websites resulted in new features incorporated in Bing search engine.\\

  & We worked on the hypothesis that Chemistry is more closed in terms of collaboration among researchers than other Physical Sciences such as Physics and Mathematics. We analysed the graph of publication authors from reputed journals induced by co-authorship and affiliations and contrasted Chemistry with other Physical Sciences.\\
