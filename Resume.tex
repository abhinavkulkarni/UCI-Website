  & Study of evolution of open-source Java projects over time by identifying software aspects and concerns as latent topics using probabilitstic topic modelling (LDA). We studied how topic scattering across a release and source code files make-up in terms of topics change over multiple releases and identified outliying projects. Overall effort was a part of comparative study of Object and Aspect Oriented Programming paradigm.\\

  & The focus was on improving relevance of algorithmic search overall as well as in specific segments by employing statistical methods to mine information from user click patterns from Internet Explorer and Microsoft Toolbar user click logs. My work on relevance of local search queries (containing locations) and offline computation of geo-specific popularity of websites resulted in new features incorporated in Bing search engine.\\

  \multirow{2}{2.5cm}{PROJECT\\WORK} & \textbf{Chemistry Corpus Analysis}\hfill Winter \oldstylenums{2012}, UC Irvine\\
  & We worked on the hypothesis that Chemistry is more closed in terms of collaboration among researchers than other Physical Sciences such as Physics and Mathematics. We analysed the graph of publication authors from reputed journals induced by co-authorship and affiliations and contrasted Chemistry with other Physical Sciences.\\

  & Participated in \href{http://www.heritagehealthprize.com/c/hhp}{HHP Prize competition} hosted by \href{http://www.kaggle.com}{Kaggle}, a predictive modeling and analytics platform. Implemented machine learning algorithms to identify patients admitted to a hospital within next year using historical claims, drug and lab data.\\
