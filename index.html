<h3>About Me</h3>
I am a Masters student in school of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu">Information and Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a>.
<br>
My research interests are in the areas bordering on both Computer
Science and Applied Statistics such as Machine Learning and Text Mining.<br><br>
I completed my undergraduate education from <a href="http://www.nitt.edu">National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirapally, India</a> in 2009.
<br>
I worked in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/OnlineServiceDivision/bing.aspx">Online Services Devision of Microsoft Inc., Hyderabad, India</a>
for a little less than two years before deciding to leave for further
education. Please refer to my resume for my work at Microsoft.<br>

<h3>Master's Thesis</h3>
I am currently being advised by <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eihler/">Prof. Alex Ihler</a> for a Master's thesis. We are working on designing efficient machine learning models to evaluate Go boards and predict final territory by using local patterns and couplings between adjacent stones in the Go board.<br>
<br>
Background: According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29"> Wikipedia entry for Go</a>, the game originated in China around 2,500 years back. The end goal of the game is to capture maximum possible territory. Despite its simple rules, Go has thwarted many attempts to automate it because of computational complexity and as a result traditional techniques such as alpha-beta pruning cannot be employed. <a href="http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips17/NIPS2004_0747.pdf">Some</a> <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1143954">work</a> <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ssanner/Papers/crfgo.pdf">has</a> been done to construct machine learning models that learn coupling between adjacent stones and make use of neighbouring terriory of a stone position.
<br>
<h3>Research Work</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Complexity Evolution of Software Projects:</span> In the summer and Fall of 2012 I worked with <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Elopes/">Prof. Crista Lopes</a>
on the problem of analyzing open-source Java projects of varying types
and sizes to understand how they evolved over time (i.e. over multiple
releases). Currently we identify software concerns and aspects as
latent topics using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">LDA</a>
and draw different matrices regarding project complexity using entropies of distributions of topic
and source code files. We were able to identify a general trend in the development of the projects by employing a simple linear regression model. Standard statistical techniques can be used to identify outlying software projects so they can be closely
studied to identify what went different in the management of those projects.
This study is continuation of an earlier work, details about which can
be found in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1449807">this paper</a>.<br>
<br>

<h3><a>Projects</a></h3>

<h4><a>HHP Health Prize </a><a href="http://www.heritagehealthprize.com/c/hhp/">(Link)</a></h4>
I, part of a team of three, worked on a <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>
project to identify patients who would be admitted to hospitals given
medical history of previous years. We implemented various
classification and prediction algorithms to get an estimate. The
compition is still on and carries a prize pool of $3 million.
<br>
<h4>PNAS Chemistry Corpus Analysis</h4>
We did analysis of <a href="http://www.pnas.org">PNAS</a>
Chemistry corpus from over two decades. Our hypothesis was that research
in Chemistry, unlike other physical sciences such as Physics and
Mathematics, is conducted in much smaller groups and scope
of collaboration is limited, in most cases, to other people in same
affiilated institutes. We found evidence that suggests our hypothesis.
